# behaviorTreeToolKit
** Inspired by BHVT made by praydog so I wanna let this api widely used in common luascript mod then replace some of file mods in a way**
This is a mhr modding library and depend on reframework by praydog and BHVT api in the newer version of reframework, so certainly it cannot be used in MHWIB
